        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken and potatoes is a classic. I don't have the energy or courage to cater for a living but, if I did, 
            <br>this lemony dish would be one of my go-to entrees, and not just for big, fat weddings. It's a proven crowd-pleaser, 
            <br>simple to make, and easy on the wallet.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Add lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, dried oregano, salt, rosemary, black pepper, and cayenne. 
                <br>Toss until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Place chicken pieces skin-side up in the prepared pan. Tuck potato pieces around chicken. Drizzle with 2/3 cup chicken broth. Spoon any 
                <br> remaining marinade from the bowl over chicken and potatoes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes, then place chicken skin-side up again.</li>
            <li>Continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25 minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the 
                <br> bone should register 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm; leave potatoes in the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn on the broiler, or set oven to highest heat. Toss potatoes again to coat in pan juices. 
                <br> Place the pan under the broiler and broil until potatoes are crisped, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer potatoes to the platter with chicken.</li>
            <li>Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the remaining 1/3 cup chicken broth and scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. 
                <br> Strain pan juices over chicken and potatoes. Sprinkle with fresh oregano.</li>
        </ol>
